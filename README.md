## Steps that I took to create this editor.
1. I have set up a new git repository. 🧬
2. I have uploaded the [wtf-gulp-starterkit](https://github.com/maciejkorsan/wtf-gulp-starter). 🧰
3. I use a git branch to make changes.
4. I created a simple graphic design and transferred it to HTML and CSS code.
5. I use the querySelector function to get the textarea and buttons element.
