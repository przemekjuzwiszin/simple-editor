## Steps that I took to create this editor: 🏆
1. I have set up a new git repository.
2. I have uploaded the [wtf-gulp-starterkit](https://github.com/maciejkorsan/wtf-gulp-starter).
3. I use a git branch to make changes.
4. I created a simple graphic design and transferred it to HTML and CSS code.
5. I use the querySelector function to get the textarea and buttons element.
6. To buttons I added EventListener method.
    - button save: saves the content in local storage.
    - button load: loads content from local storage.
