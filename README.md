# Refresh-resistant editor.

Please visit this page to see the editor üßê: [simply-editor](https://przemekjuzwiszin.github.io/simple-editor)


## Steps that I took to create this editor.
1. I have set up a new git repository. üß¨
2. I have uploaded the [wtf-gulp-starterkit](https://github.com/maciejkorsan/wtf-gulp-starter). üß∞
3. I use a git branch to make changes.
4. I created a simple graphic design and transferred it to HTML and CSS code.
5. I use the querySelector function to get the textarea and buttons element.
6. To buttons I added EventListener method.
    - button save: saves the content in local storage.
    - button load: loads content from local storage.


## Tools that I used in the project:
- git
- node.js & npm
- gulp starterkit
    - local server with auto refresh
    - SCSS and sourcemap support
- Trello
- Figma
- Visual Studio Code
